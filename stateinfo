1.component state allow our components to manage some data

2. steps:
     1.setup default state object
     2.component is rendered with default state values *   (* here means behind the scenes we dont have to do it manually)
     3.change state based on event
     4.component rerendered using new state values *
     5.start again at 3

3. our state is just an object.it is a set of key value pairs

4. call to this.setState() is asynchronous. this.setState() allow us to manipulate the state object.

5. a component cannot change its own props ,new props values can get passed down from the parent and those will 
   trigger a re-render in the child

6. WE SHOULD HAVE state condensed into just a few places

7. passing a function to setState is preffered way than passing an object
