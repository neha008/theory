1. React uses virtual DOM which is JS object.This will improve app performance since JS virtual DOM os faster
   than the regular DOM.
2. React uses some virtual DOM algorithm in JS to determine the minimal number of changes that need to be made
   in order to correctly render the new application.
3. If a single piece of our application changes , we can re-render the application , updating it without 
   worring about slowing down the user or wasting a ton of resources.
