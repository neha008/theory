1. local storage only work with string data but we want to use others like object,array etc so we use JSON for 
   conversion

2. JSON is just a string representation of javascript object or an array. It stands for javascript object notation.

3. JSON.stringify is going to take a regular javascript object and get the string representation

4. JSON.parse is going to take string representation and return a true javascript object.
