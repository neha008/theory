1. webpack is an asset bundler.so its going to allow us to take all the stuffs that makes up our application and 
   combine that with stuff from third party libraries and spin out a single javascript file.

2. it allows us to organise our javascript.So when we run our app through webpack we are going to get 
   a single javascript file back and that file what's called the bundle is going to contain everything
   our application needs to run.It is going to contain our dependencies.
   it is also going to contain our application code.

3. node modules folder contain third party dependencies like react or react-dom

4.webpack.config.js file should be in the root of your folder.It is a node script.So we have access to everything 
 we would have access to inside of nodejs application.
